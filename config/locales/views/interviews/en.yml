      This is extremely important to ensure automatic rejection emails are sent to the correct applicants.
      Applicants with status "Accepted", "Offered, but said no" and "Rejected, contacted directly" will NOT GET A REJECTION EMAIL.
      Rejections are only for this job, so if the applicant is given a different job you must still set the status to rejected.

      These timeslots are later used to automatically assign interview times for applicants.
